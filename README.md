### Scrum team
* Product owner: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
* Scrum master: Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum.
* Development Team: Professionals who do the job of delivering an increase in "finished" product.

### Scrum events
in Scrum there are predefined events in order to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

* Sprint: It's the heart of Scrum where an increase in the product is created.
* Sprint planning: Ceremony to define what will be done duaring the sprint.
* Daily Scrum (Daily stand-up): Daily meeting of the entire development team.
* Sprint review: It's where the increase developed duaring the sprint is shown.
* Scrum retrospective: Opportunity to apply continuous improvement.

### Scrum artifacts
Scrum artifacts represent work or value in various ways that are useful for providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

* Product list (Produc Backlog): It's an ordered list of everything that is known that is necessary in the product.
* List of sprint earrings (Sprint Backlog): Items in the product list selected for the sprint.

## SCRUM Team
THe team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity and productivity.

* Product owner: Architect understands how the project is to be built.
* Scrum master: It's one that must carry out a continuous process.
* Development team: Those who build the product.

Scrum teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.

### Dependencies
It's ideal to organize teams thinking of minimizing dependencies with external entities.

### Types of organization
Teams can be organized based on functionalities or components.

### How to form a Scrum team
1) Build a team with all the professional profiles you need to develop your project.
2) Make up a team of 3 to 9 people, small and flexible.
3) Make sure you have all Scrum roles.
4) Maintain daily sessions of maximum 15 minutes with a specific objective.

## The role of the product owner
It's responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the development team.
The product owner is the only person responsible for managing the product list.

### Responsability
* Be clear about the items in the product list.
* Prioritize the work value of the development team.
* Ensure that the product list is visible, transparent and clear.
* Ensure that the development team knows the elements of the product list.

The decisions of the product owner are reflected in the content and in the prioritization of the product list.
No one can force the development team to work based on a different set of requirements.

## The role of the Scrum master
He is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum by helping everyone understand Scrum's theory, practices, rules and values.

The Scrum master is a leader who is at the service of the Scrum team.

It helps people outside the Scrum team to understand which interactions with the Scrum team can be useful and wich not.

### crum master service to the product owner
* Ensure thath the objective, scope and mastery of the product are understood by everyone in the Scrum team in the best possible way.
* Facilitate Scrum events as required or needed.

### Scrum master service to the development team
* Guide the development team in being self-organized and multifunctional.
* Help the develpment team create high value products.
* Remove impediments to the progress of the development team.

## The basis of the development team
The development team consists of professionals who perform the work of delivering an increase in "finished" product that can potentially be Ã±ut into production at the end of each Sprint.

The organization is responsible for structuring and empowering develpment teams to organize and manage their own work.

### Catalog of the development team
* Self-organization: They define who develops each process according to their abilities.
* Multifunctional: Tasks of different types without the need for external resources.
* They have no titles: Everyone is equal and responsible in the same way for fulfilling the Spring objective.
* There are no sub-teams: Everyone works in single team at the same pace of work.
* The development team cannot be modified until the sprint is finished.

### Development team size
The optimal size of the develpment team is small enough to remain agile and large enough to complete a significant amount of work.
